      "summary": "## Hello, World!\n\n### Key Highlights\n- Swiggy scaled their Postgres database by cleaning unused indexes, controlling auto-vacuum, and using pg_repack for online maintenance and better performance.\n- The company initially used Postgres 9.3 on AWS RDS, but later migrated to Postgres 9.6 to take advantage of improved auto-vacuum features.\n- Swiggy's journey provides valuable lessons for managing Postgres in production, including understanding MVCC, indexes, and vacuuming.\n\n### Detailed Points\n- Swiggy's Postgres instance was initially running on Postgres 9.3 on AWS RDS, using mostly default parameter groups.\n- The company had a daily downtime window, during which they ran VACUUM FULL nightly to clean up dead tuples and reclaim space.\n- However, this approach had drawbacks, including reliance on a downtime window and no guarantee the job would finish in time.\n- Swiggy decided to adopt a more automated and scalable approach, using pg_repack to remove bloat and reorganize tables online without locking them exclusively.\n- The company also fine-tuned auto-vacuum by adjusting parameters to balance system performance and resource utilization.\n- Swiggy's experience shows that scaling Postgres is not just about throwing hardware at the problem, but also about smart database management.\n\n### Important Links\n- Read Online: https://elinkade.hw-mail.glich.co/ss/c/u001.oo1OKvJJLUMQEpEGxXjgTGLn25832Ov2jw1_s7gIr-eZwdT-4AaRd6ovl7A5dbBPbRlkzKejQxgsKP08XUviqrHpT6iI9Z6VbVhRHb82CftHSlCTNAi9USJsb-83ufp08fFpDLmcKmhUaZ5b17pFsseLMu5mJUZE9dB9FaCOrZi7TN1Ed4mdvHzlBYjZTihBsgL2rLqS1JBXWYcwc-Hyitg0ktMQezYbxoNfOIA5aQHKKO_J6I6SQnKdue0YE5ZkzFQ555FOiYRd9EzEHPVv5EJrEeT9YxOBGG-FJ94k4_bhNkwbY4p8yDU4Lqy-OhZG0NuiPOY43WyHUWk_3qcVktpBE4avEsKAavlOCw3CYokpcem2bzpFy1CHZlpJ36UEs2shl0_YQD5i5sZyV2FCER6gBN_-b5eKcTWl4idrLboT17xS43hLhoN9yQ7aH3MJuQQqujJXuIcCJMeCV0xwc7MZYEA8OZPYuwa_ihD23iVUtnXKECJFE791XxmeoRzmObrEDaQnBloYVwoF36wxhLC2TaXlhCBUCRMirIdVboC1F-kU0I2ZULPWaNn10CIBOZt9Po0ABQrhFnqb6SWi4oCtp7h3DbX-_9ec3j_r9aWumdbPNYxBpZtROd8npeDZoFsrRG3DW6bFTw19QhxgC9j8EpzjOsjL3tQVo8daUfbm1nhNeAL37ozYcWj0NyEBRs07C_0ZS4vzjsZA0_JKpqZ8_sUAs26JNbqvd8NfvaKmaA1QYrVlRZcGJpZLfmR7KkFdsdaGLo6IVBVVV9BU_2wtzUVsqAzh0lQluwJPtKIYjcCz_X_14lbdyYPE71rz1yP1Y1SYMu2TXkvj3Ss5djLPuBk4wTuC2jOWRpnEcNY/4l3/YuUZKz5XSjiJ7YZ4dTSs5A/h0/h001.HBB6VryLzpgX82lGiAIbAQmh1P5pkUKPt25s43kj13I\n- Hello World: https://elinkade.hw-mail.glich.co/ss/c/u001.oo1OKvJJLUMQEpEGxXjgTLedhx6dRnmvkZCOvN53kB6-mEyat_hNl049PoQu9Mxi8bxquiDNwmKXs_k2mgpWKWdeS0apKxPeXeP4HFTC7AAXDk44SyK1jwXtdvgEojwV50MQj0nXN-bJ8VyicuMo56X87Os6hS7sD7eO1rwIqXrBUlx9k2gFxE4r807lAc5kmHuyfjb3m5GF414MDclI5vafdUU9XQslVR9__Nwm6FfxzBszT2WGxWTUy7yx4wBiR4AfkpmPzLikKJJkzsSTc0ZHtcIoKSro6To-IpDNyzs8E0Fuo9my5dkvJcQ-HyUKc0lBvX-k8YJaHq3syvD8JoxhxAfek__m2waaXa3FowVjv02Mvd1KaoxeqwyI1tBhJzo8z1_NI7nNF0g6vzeQIk0VQkv3WqOjxB_utdFmhiD5TjKB2sKWfPu1xTzsLrwRFf2nXef7bvyJeu6SleX4hpUTa2F8S6qiQ4NrSzPWXuwBmNuM-HePmyZsWAWzGuifqEw3iW0SoRg_XNf4erKuqjHT4uDzVIDUefhxf7d2KEieT6SEPZzah-tdx9OCc4zYTDotmJoJLru243MpjjUWyJAX_25eWkn0klpTx4MORjBO2pKZOVbKhunDw66yBnHEMCMlgXAhtnglJUfa4ZHtbQCpgx9nwwU5haRDMHmh5iS7TEnGaFlqVr-IbSglzI2nQCMLWJ_-EWj1bo-oPzrQeyMktif4Bo1fURZDDHDWj_lIVyw8NbD91-3fQBtPUdgLC7lFCseKhKQicxShem1REBShKii60GJ9Nq1Hfnjx1SkGHtGWu0kBmGXfWSgfUiR8/4l3/YuUZKz5XSjiJ7YZ4dTSs5A/h9/h001.3wrAvkUIpVPeHX-r-qIUOWXM66mVdT5ZSKk1Kn4tXzo",

Gemini Visual Layout feature can synthesize an interactive layout to represent information on a given topic.\n- Researchers have identified three key levers that make AI agents significantly smarter: data quality, algorithm design, and reasoning style.\n\n### Detailed Points\n- OpenAI's music generator is a significant creative push, marking its most ambitious creative push since 2020's Jukebox.\n- The model can generate full compositions or add specific instrumental layers based on user direction.\n- OpenAI has enlisted Juilliard students to annotate sheet music used in training.\n- Google's Gemini Visual Layout feature is a shot across the bow of OpenAI's Pulse and a signal that Google wants Gemini to handle serious workflow logic before its long-awaited \"Agent Mode\" automates execution.\n- Researchers have identified three key levers that make AI agents significantly smarter: data quality, algorithm design, and reasoning style.\n- Data quality proved critical, with models trained on authentic, continuous learning trajectories capturing full reasoning workflows.\n- Algorithm design also made a difference, with token-level scoring combined with broader exploration and optimized rewards improving both stability and accuracy.\n- Reasoning strategy mattered, with deliberative models that plan actions carefully outperforming reactive models.\n- The DemyAgent-4B achieved competitive results across math, science, and coding benchmarks.\n- Microsoft Outlook is getting an AI overhaul under new leaders.\n- Meta AI is prepping a major feature push as TBD Lab takes the reins.\n- A study found that leading AI models spiral into compulsive betting — and can’t stop until they lose it all.\n- Dropbox has rolled out Dash, an AI assistant that actually understands your files.\n- A new study found that AI chatbots cite obscure websites that never make Google’s top results.\n- Misleading claims that most web content is now AI-generated are spreading on social media.\n- AI policy without proof is just politics, says Berkeley professor calling for independent oversight.\n- Trump and Xi are set to finalize a TikTok pact, marking a truce in the global AI race.\n\n### Important Links\n- OpenAI's music generator:

      "summary": "## JournalClub.io\n\n### Key Highlights\n- A recent paper introduces \"Asymmetric Distributed Trust\" in distributed systems, providing a way for different processes to have individual trust assumptions.\n- This approach replaces traditional symmetric Byzantine fault tolerance with asymmetric trust models.\n- Each process defines its own trust assumptions and corresponding quorums based on those assumptions.\n\n### Detailed Points\n- The concept of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) in distributed systems is discussed, emphasizing its ability to function despite some nodes failing or acting maliciously.\n- Traditional symmetric BFT assumes a global trust model, where all nodes trust the same set of nodes; however, real-world scenarios often involve asymmetric trust relationships.\n- The proposed \"Asymmetric Byzantine Quorum\" system allows each process to define its own trust assumptions and generate quorums accordingly.\n- Two key properties of quorum systems are discussed: consistency (preventing conflicting decisions) and availability (ensuring progress despite failures).\n- The paper introduces the concepts of \"naive\" and \"wise\" processes, based on their ability to anticipate actual failure patterns and make informed trust decisions.\n- \"Wise\" processes, which correctly anticipated the failure pattern, receive strong guarantees, while \"naive\" processes receive weaker guarantees.\n- The concept of a \"guild\" is introduced as a set of wise processes that satisfies certain properties, ensuring liveness and preventing conflicting decisions.\n- The paper also discusses the \"tolerated system,\" which represents the set of all failure patterns that can be tolerated by the system, satisfying the same mathematical properties as a symmetric Byzantine quorum system.\n\n### Important Points to Consider\n- Asymmetric trust systems are more complex to reason about and implement than symmetric systems, requiring careful consideration of which processes receive guarantees and under what conditions.\n- Identifying wise processes and ensuring they can form effective guilds is crucial for system progress.\n- Asymmetric trust models may be beneficial for systems spanning organizational boundaries or having participants with differing risk tolerances and institutional constraints.\n\n### Important Links\n- Watch or Listen to the Episode: [https://journalclub.io/episodes/asymmetric-distributed-trust?token=yLVPoQHDRc2TcNHK9YU3Vr5kt5cv9BRh8bwBn17A13bYtvJICI](https://journalclub.io/episodes/asymmetric-distributed-trust?token=yLVPoQHDRc2TcNHK9YU3Vr5kt5cv9BRh8bwBn17A13bYtvJICI)\n- Read the Original Paper: [https://journalclub.io/track/EQINV8PELkVwoPCMsgYnNzegeD4gqhww9QH4LdsaLe79LOzqdP](https://journalclub.io/track/EQINV8PELkVwoPCMsgYnNzegeD4gqhww9QH4LdsaLe79LOzqdP)\n- Privacy: [https://journalclub.io/track/Oyq9k1RLeQi2NNvGljoEKMsuwWn2ykqDDz7mmdTPqq1piREIMw](https://journalclub.io/track/Oyq9k1RLeQi2NNvGljoEKMsuwWn2ykqDDz7mmdTPqq1piREIMw)\n- Preferences: [https://journalclub.io/track/UVvQ5C3BivrPPCEZIo0kwRpE4ISw7Y06NWXfw8cXL1qHg20APo](https://journalclub.io/track/UVvQ5C3BivrPPCEZIo0kwRpE4ISw7Y06NWXfw8cXL1qHg20APo)",

      "originalContent": "Asymmetric Distributed Trust   \n\nIf you've worked on a distributed system before, you might have encountered the concept of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). It’s the ability of a decentralized network to function and continue to reach consensus even after some nodes fail. It also works if those nodes are acting maliciously, or for some other reason can’t be trusted at the moment. It involves something called Byzantine quorum systems, where you need agreement from a certain number of nodes (but not all the nodes) before you trust a decision.\n\n![](https://journalclub.io/px/A7qchGIeYBd5zYdrn3jw42KTP9FJHiubxyTa0zAoJ08GHKq1mz)\n\nAsymmetric Distributed Trust\n\nJournalClub.io, October 27th 2025  \n  \n\n[![Thumbnail of today's episode.](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/uxRih3KITj2UhhgQSR2W)](https://journalclub.io/episodes/asymmetric-distributed-trust?token=yLVPoQHDRc2TcNHK9YU3Vr5kt5cv9BRh8bwBn17A13bYtvJICI)\n\nToday's article comes from the journal of Distributed Computing.
